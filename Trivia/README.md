In index.html, add beneath “Part 1” a multiple-choice trivia question of your choosing with HTML. There should be at least three answer choices, of which exactly one should be correct.

In index.html, add beneath “Part 2” a text-based free response question of your choosing with HTML. You should use an input field to let the user type a response. You should use a button to let the user confirm their answer.

Using JavaScript, add logic so that the text field and buttons changes color when a user confirms their answer.If the user gives an incorrect answer , the text field or  buttons should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”. If the user gives the correct answer , the input field or button should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”.
